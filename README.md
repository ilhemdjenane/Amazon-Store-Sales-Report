## Introduction
As an Analytics Consultant for an Amazon store, I was tasked with developing a high-level KPI report for the executive team. This report uses transactional sales data from 2005 to 2008, covering thousands of products, sales territories, and customer demographics. The goal was to transform this data into actionable insights to reflect the companyâ€™s performance over the years. The analysis focused on key areas such as total revenue, profit margins, quarterly performance, and regional contributions, providing strategic insights to drive decision-making and optimize future strategies.

## Quarterly Profit Analysis

From 2005 to 2008, the quarterly profits show notable growth patterns with significant variations across years. In 2005, the second half of the year performed better, with Q3 generating $6M and Q4 reaching $7M in profit. The year 2006 started strong with Q1 contributing $8M, followed by Q2 at $9M. However, the second half of 2006 saw a decline, with both Q3 and Q4 contributing only $6M each.

In 2007, quarterly profits rebounded with consistent growth throughout the year. Q1 and Q2 profits were $6M and $7M, respectively, while Q3 jumped to $12M. The year ended with Q4 delivering a peak profit of $18M. This upward trend continued into 2008, with Q1 and Q2 contributing $18M and $23M, respectively. However, Q3 of 2008 marked a sharp decline to $297K, a significant drop compared to previous quarters.

This analysis highlights the need to investigate the factors behind the sharp decline in Q3 of 2008 while leveraging the strategies that contributed to the consistent growth observed in 2007 and early 2008.
