## Introduction
As an Analytics Consultant for an Amazon store, I was tasked with developing a high-level KPI report for the executive team. This report uses transactional sales data from 2005 to 2008, covering thousands of products, sales territories, and customer demographics. The goal was to transform this data into actionable insights to reflect the company’s performance over the years. The analysis focused on key areas such as total revenue, profit margins, quarterly performance, and regional contributions, providing strategic insights to drive decision-making and optimize future strategies.

By 2006, transactions surged to 2.68K, leading to a revenue increase of 108.24% to $69.48M and a profit margin of 40.6%, resulting in $28.18M in profit from 28.41K orders. The year 2007 marked the most significant growth, with transactions jumping to 24.44K, generating $102.38M in revenue and achieving a profit margin of 41.6%. Total profit peaked at $42.55M from 255.72K orders. In 2008, the upward trend in transactions and order quantities continued, reaching 32.27K transactions and 337.39K orders. However, revenue slightly declined to $101.86M with a profit margin of 41.4%, resulting in a total profit of $42.16M. Over the years, the store demonstrated consistent growth in transactions and order quantities, with notable performance improvements in 2006 and 2007.

## Quarterly Profit Analysis

From 2005 to 2008, the quarterly profits show notable growth patterns with significant variations across years. In 2005, the second half of the year performed better, with Q3 generating $6M and Q4 reaching $7M in profit. The year 2006 started strong with Q1 contributing $8M, followed by Q2 at $9M. However, the second half of 2006 saw a decline, with both Q3 and Q4 contributing only $6M each.

In 2007, quarterly profits rebounded with consistent growth throughout the year. Q1 and Q2 profits were $6M and $7M, respectively, while Q3 jumped to $12M. The year ended with Q4 delivering a peak profit of $18M. This upward trend continued into 2008, with Q1 and Q2 contributing $18M and $23M, respectively. However, Q3 of 2008 marked a sharp decline to $297K, a significant drop compared to previous quarters.

This analysis highlights the need to investigate the factors behind the sharp decline in Q3 of 2008 while leveraging the strategies that contributed to the consistent growth observed in 2007 and early 2008.

## Regional Profit Analysis

From 2005 to 2008, the regional profit contributions show a consistent upward trend across key markets, with notable performance in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

In 2005, Australia led with $5.40M in profits, followed by the United States at $4.36M. Other regions, such as the United Kingdom ($1.30M), Germany ($1.03M), Canada ($637.50K), and France ($674.44K), contributed relatively smaller amounts.

In 2006, both Australia and the United States experienced significant growth, generating $9.55M and $9.01M, respectively. Other regions also saw increases, with Canada contributing $2.75M and France, Germany, and the United Kingdom each surpassing $2M in profits.

The year 2007 marked the peak for most regions. Australia ($12.89M) and the United States ($12.70M) dominated the market, followed by the United Kingdom at $5.65M. Germany and France also showed strong contributions, with $4.60M and $4.23M, respectively. Canada remained steady at $2.48M.

In 2008, while Australia’s profits slightly declined to $10.87M, the United States surged to $14.47M, becoming the top-performing region. The United Kingdom remained strong at $5.32M, while Germany ($4.58M) and France ($4.01M) continued their consistent contributions. Canada saw modest growth, reaching $2.92M.

This regional analysis highlights the United States and Australia as consistent top performers, with significant growth opportunities in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Continued focus on these regions can help sustain profitability and expand market share globally.

## Weekday vs. Weekend Profit Analysis

From 2005 to 2008, the Amazon Store consistently generated higher profits during weekdays compared to weekends, reflecting the dominant role of weekday sales in driving overall profitability.

In 2005, weekdays contributed $9.72M, nearly three times the profit generated over weekends ($3.68M). This trend continued in 2006, where weekday profits surged to $20.26M, representing a 108.41% increase, while weekend profits increased to $7.91M (+114.95%).

The year 2007 marked a peak in both weekday and weekend profits. Weekdays generated $30.78M, a 51.97% increase from 2006, while weekend profits reached $11.76M (+48.63%). This established weekdays as the primary driver of overall profitability.

In 2008, weekday profits slightly declined to $30.17M, a marginal decrease of 1.98%, while weekend profits rose to $11.99M (+1.96%), narrowing the gap between weekday and weekend contributions.

Overall, weekday sales consistently accounted for the majority of profits, highlighting the need for continued optimization of weekday strategies. However, the steady growth in weekend profits suggests untapped opportunities for further expansion through targeted campaigns and promotions.

## Recommendations

1. **Strengthen High-Performing Regions (United States and Australia):**
   These regions consistently lead in profitability, especially the United States, which peaked at $14.47M in 2008. Focus on: 
- Expanding product offerings tailored to these markets.
- Enhancing marketing campaigns to maintain customer loyalty and attract new segments.
- Improving logistics and supply chain efficiency to ensure timely delivery and lower costs in these regions.

2. **Expand in Growing Markets (United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and France):**
   Regions like the United Kingdom ($5.65M in 2007), Germany ($4.60M in 2007), and France ($4.23M in 2007) show steady growth. To accelerate performance: 
- Increase localized marketing efforts, such as region-specific promotions or partnerships.
- Invest in market research to better understand customer preferences and adjust product strategies accordingly.
- Build or optimize distribution networks to improve service and reduce shipping times.

3. **Monitor Declining Growth in Australia:**

   While Australia was a top performer, its profits slightly declined in 2008 ($10.87M from $12.89M in 2007). Consider: 
- Identifying and addressing reasons for the decline, such as market saturation or competition.
- Reinventing marketing strategies with a focus on customer retention and loyalty programs.
- Launching new product lines or exclusive deals to re-engage the market.


4. **Capitalize on Weekend Growth:**

  Although weekend profits are lower than weekdays, the consistent growth (e.g., $7.91M in 2006 to $11.99M in 2008) shows potential for further development. Consider:
  - Offering weekend-exclusive promotions or flash sales to increase traffic and transactions.
  - Launching campaigns targeting leisure shoppers who are more active during weekends.
  - Leveraging social media and email marketing on Fridays and Saturdays to attract customers for weekend purchases.


5. **Focus on Customer Insights and Personalization:**
- Use data analytics to better understand customer behavior in each region.
- Personalize campaigns, recommendations, and communication to meet the specific needs of customers in each country.


5. **Plan for Long-Term Growth:**
- Analyze customer data to forecast future demand and plan production and marketing accordingly.
- Build a robust feedback loop with customers to continually refine products and services


6. **Leverage Trends in Transaction Growth:**
Transactions grew significantly, especially in 2007 (24.44K) and 2008 (32.27K). Focus on: 
- Encouraging repeat purchases by offering loyalty programs or incentives.
- Expanding customer base through targeted digital marketing.
- Streamlining checkout processes and improving customer experience to increase transaction volume.
