## Introduction
As an Analytics Consultant for an Amazon store, I was tasked with developing a high-level KPI report for the executive team. This report uses transactional sales data from 2005 to 2008, covering thousands of products, sales territories, and customer demographics. The goal was to transform this data into actionable insights to reflect the companyâ€™s performance over the years. The analysis focused on key areas such as total revenue, profit margins, quarterly performance, and regional contributions, providing strategic insights to drive decision-making and optimize future strategies.
